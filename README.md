# sagebrush_demography

This is a repository for code and data for the dissertation of Andrew Kleinhesselink at Utah State University. 
The code creates a database for my field data called "sage.sqlite" and updates it.  There is also code for graphing the data and conducting statistical analysis on the data.

NOTE: The data and code in this repository is still under development.

The raw data for this project stored on excel spreadsheets on a local network at USU. The R-scripts read in these files in order to setup and update the database.
